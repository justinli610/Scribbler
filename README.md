Scribbler
=========
SE 101 Group Project

##Introduction
The Scribbler robot group project exists in order to introduce the first year Software Engineering at University of Waterloo to working with hardware limitations in real life. The Myro Scribbler bot is equipped with extremely terrible hardware, which makes it the perfect piece of hardware for prospective software engineers to work with.
  Initially the objective of our team is to write a program that will make the robot avoid obstacles with the help of its terrible sensors. After this initial demo, we will start working towards our main project: A text-speech and speech-text program.

##Obstacle Avoidance
###Initial conditions
The robot is set on the floor with a box and/or other obstacles in its path.
###Objective
The robot must avoid the hitting the obstacle by moving around it.
###Requirements
While avoiding the obstacle the robot must remain within 2-5 cm (1-2 inches) of the object, furthermore the
robot should return to its original route after successfully avoiding the object. That is, the robot may not
touch the object nor may it deviate too much from its course.
###First Demo Grading
For tests (1)-(3), there is 1 mark for staying within the specified distance from the obstacle and 1 mark for
returning to within 20Â° of the original trajectory.
